# Continued-Fraction-Rationals

## Description
This is a small C++ library that provides a space-efficient encoding of continued-fraction integer sequences.

## Anatomy
There are a few sections to this project.
- The encoding's **space-efficiency** is compared to theoretical limits and other previous works in the *Proofs & Demo.ipynb* file.
- An **implementation** of the encoding in C++ is located in the *Implementation* folder.
- Other relevant works are listed in the *Reading* folder.

## Installation
Download the *Implementation* folder. (This package has no dependencies.)

## Usage
The full functionality is implemented in the class `WholeNumSeq`, which is declared in the header *WholeNumSeq.h*.
